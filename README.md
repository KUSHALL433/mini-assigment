# Sample Transcript 1 
Customer: Hi, I ordered a laptop two weeks ago, but I haven’t received any update on shipping. Can you please check the status?<br>
Support Agent: You’ll have to wait. We’re dealing with a lot of orders right now.<br>
Customer: I understand, but can you at least tell me if it has been shipped? I need it for work.<br>
Support Agent: Like I said, we’re busy. It will come when it comes.<br>
Customer: That’s not helpful. Can I speak to a manager?<br>
Support Agent: The manager will tell you the same thing. Do you want to wait or not?<br>
Customer: This is very frustrating. I just need information.<br>
Support Agent: Well, if you’re not happy, you can cancel the order. Anything else?<br>

# Sample Transcript 2
Agent: Good afternoon, thank you for calling BrightNet Internet Support. My name is Sarah. How may I help you today?<br>
Customer: Hi Sarah, my internet connection has been dropping on and off since this morning.<br>
Agent: I’m sorry to hear that. Could you please confirm your account number or the phone number linked to your account?<br>
Customer: Sure, it’s 987654321.<br>
Agent: Thank you. I see your account is active. Let me run a quick line test… (pause) Okay, I’m detecting some instability in your area. Are the router lights blinking when the internet drops?<br>
Customer: Yes, the DSL light keeps flashing.<br>
Agent: Understood. This looks like a service disruption. Our technicians are already working on it, and it should be resolved within the next 3 hours.<br>
Customer: Okay, that’s good to know. Do I need to do anything from my side?<br>
Agent: No, once the issue is fixed, your router should reconnect automatically. If it doesn’t, try restarting it after 3 hours.<br>
Customer: Alright, thanks for your help.<br>
Agent: You’re very welcome! Is there anything else I can assist you with today?<br>
Customer: No, that’s all.<br>
Agent: Great. Thank you for calling BrightNet. Have a good day!<br>
