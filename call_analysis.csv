"Customer: Hi, I ordered a laptop two weeks ago, but I haven’t received any update on shipping. Can you please check the status?
Support Agent: You’ll have to wait. We’re dealing with a lot of orders right now.
Customer: I understand, but can you at least tell me if it has been shipped? I need it for work.

Customer: That’s not helpful. Can I speak to a manager?
Support Agent: The manager will tell you the same thing. Do you want to wait or not?
Customer: This is very frustrating. I just need information.
Support Agent: Well, if you’re not happy, you can cancel the order. Anything else?","A customer inquired about the status of their laptop order, which had been placed two weeks prior.
